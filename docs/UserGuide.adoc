== Introduction

RestOrRant (ROR) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, ROR is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, ROR can get your restaurant management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `RestOrRant.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your RestOrRant application.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  The application has three modes: Restaurant Mode, Table Mode and Menu Mode. RestOrRant starts in Restaurant Mode by default. You can switch between the modes using the *`xxxMode` commands. Each mode comes with a set of commands to perform mode-specific operations.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`addTables 2 1 4`* (in Restaurant Mode): adds 3 tables to the restaurant with 2, 1 and 4 seats respectively.
* *`menuMode`: switches RestOrRant to Menu Mode and displays the list of menu items for the restaurant.
* *`addToMenu c/W09 n/Chicken Wings p/12.50`* (in Menu Mode): adds a new item "W09 Chicken Wings - $12.50" to the menu.
* *`tableMode 2`*: switches RestOrRant to Table Mode for the table with table number 2 and displays the list of order items for table 2.
* *`addToOrder W09 1`* (in Table Mode): adds an order of 1x W09 to table 2.
* *`exit`* : exits the application.

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
